June 2020 - July 2020</h3>
<h4>Summer School Teacher</h4>
       
        
        
      Summer school was 100% online this year due to COVID-19. As a summer school teacher, I created lessons that meet Common Core State Standards, assessed students formally and informally, and collaborated with other teachers. During summer school, I had to make adjustments to my teaching. These adjustments included front loading students, shifting classroom activities to online activities, adjusting lessons to meet the unique needs of students during distance learning, and helping students without face-to-face interactions. Summer school was incredibly trying yet utterly amazing. I have learned more about Google than I ever imagined I would. I have made connections with students I have never met face to face. I have learned how wonderful and useful YouTube can be. I have seen the resilience and determination of our future workforce. I grew tenfold as both a person and an educator.

<h3>Palm Desert High School<br>
Desert Sands Unified School District<br>
    August 2019 - Current</h3>
<h4>Secondary Math Teacher</h4>
        
        
        I began my first year teaching in the classroom and finished distance learning. It was an
        interesting year, one for the books. As a classroom teacher, I plan, prepare, and deliver instructional activities. I collaborated with fellow math teachers to create common assessments so that we could analyze data, reflect, and adjust accordingly. In the classroom, I worked extremely hard to establish relationships with my students, to show them respect, and to show them that I genuinely cared for them and about their well being. As a first year teacher, I struggled with classroom management from time to time. I asked a ton of questions and gathered new strategies. As we approached March 2020, I was beginning to gain my confidence in the classroom and felt like “I got this!” and then COVID 19 happened and our classroom became the internet. Luckily, I have experience with going to school online and I already utilized Google Classroom so the transition wasn’t awful. I will be happy to be back in the classroom, hopefully someday soon.

<h4>Guest Teacher</h4>
        
        While I was finishing my student teaching, I was offered the opportunity to take on a long term substitute position at Palm Desert High School as a math teacher. I jumped at the opportunity. As a long term substitute teacher, I was the acting teacher. I was expected to carry out all the duties of a full time classroom teacher. I built lessons and assessments from scratch. I established a healthy and safe learning environment through open communication. I worked with other teachers to improve my teaching skills and the academic success of students. I met an amazing team of educators who helped me hit the ground running. This long term substitute position paved the way for me to become a full time classroom teacher at Palm Desert High School.
