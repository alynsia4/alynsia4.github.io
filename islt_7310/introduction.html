<p> Hi! My name is Alynsia Carrillo-Elliott. I just finished my first year of teaching. I teach high school math. It was an interesting first year, to say the least. I currently live in Southern California and I love it here. I was born and raised in Southern California, spent 3 years in Idaho and couldn’t wait to come back home! I have a five year old daughter and she keeps me super busy. </p>
    
<p> I don’t have much web application or development training. From this course I am hoping to learn more about coding. Honestly, I don’t have much of a plan for my web development skills, I want to learn something new and see if it opens any doors for me. Ultimately, I would like to work at the district office researching, designing, and implementing better technology tools for our students and our teachers.</p>
    
<p> In my free time, I like to build puzzles, watch Disney movies, eat good food, and make blankets. </p>
