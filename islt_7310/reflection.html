    <h1 id="header2">Teaching Philosophy</h1>

    
I have chosen 4 different quotes to sum up my teaching philosophy.<br>
    
    
<h3>"The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires.”</h3>
― William Arthur Ward
    
<p class="philo1"> Teaching is so much more than just telling, explaining, and demonstrating. Everyday, my goal is to inspire my students. I want my students to be inspired by me and I want to be inspired by my students. I harvest a classroom of encouragement and motivation. I want students to look up to me, I strive to be a role model. My goal is to be so much more than a teacher, my goal is to be an inspiration to all my students.</p>
    
    
<h3>“Children must be taught how to think, not what to think.”</h3>
― Margaret Mead
    
 <p class="philo">
Independent thinking is slipping away and that breaks my heart. I encourage my students to be
independent thinkers. I allow my students to struggle forward. I never just give them the answer. I want them to have a mind of their own and to have thoughts of their own. I work to maintain a classroom where my students are taught how to think, how to formulate their own opinions, and how to be independent thinkers.</p>
    
<h3>“In learning you will teach, and in teaching you will learn.”</h3>
    ― Phil Collins
    
<p class="philo">I am a firm believer in learning from everything and everyone. No matter how big, how small,
how young or how old, there is something to learn from everything. I communicate this to my
students. I also want my students to learn from me and I want to learn from my students.My
students are also teachers in my classroom. I invite their expertises into the classroom so they
can teach me and their classmates what they know. This will also help build confidence and
    tolerance in students.</p>
    
<h3>“Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.”</h3>
    ― Benjamin Franklin
    
    <p class="philo">
This quote is more of a reminder for me than anything else. This reminds me that involvement in
education is one of the most effective tools in learning. Students need to have their hands in
their own education and it is my job as a teacher to ensure they are involved. I strive to have a classroom where my students feel like they are an integral part of their education and that they are in charge of their education. My job is not to tell students, it is to teach them and most importantly involve them.    </p>
