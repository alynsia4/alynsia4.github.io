  <p>Hello! My name is Alynsia Carrillo-Elliott. My students call me Ms. Alynsia. I am currently a math teacher at Palm Desert High School. I am incredibly passionate about education. I have a five year old daughter, her name is Brantley, and she keeps me on my toes. It’s always an adventure with her around. In my spare time, I enjoy all things Disney, making blankets, building puzzles, and eating good food!</p>

<p> I began my college education career at the local community college. I was only supposed to spend two years there, but it ended up being three because I took one level of American Sign Language and fell in love. I decided to stay one extra year to finish out the four levels the college offered. After that, I transferred to Cal State Chico where I received my Bacherlor’s. I took a year off of school and then went back for my Master’s and teaching credential. I finished those in one year at Alliant University. I took another year off of school and decided to go back. I found myself at University of Missouri pursuing an Educational Specialist Degree. I think after this, my college career may be over. </p>

<p>I just finished my first year teaching. It was an interesting year, to say the least. I spent the last 3 months of school doing distance learning due to COVID 19. I have also decided to take on summer school for Summer 2020. It has been a huge learning experience and I am excited to see what else I learn and how it can help me in the fall. </p>

    <p>A tour guides job is to explain the fascinating, foreign sights you experience while traveling. Tour guides possess information and stories that makes the old building, foreign structures, and history come to life. Like a tour guide, a teacher helps students see what is captivating in the world and we expose them to new delights and adventure through learning.</p>
