<p>Hello! My name is Alynsia Carrillo-Elliott. My students call me Ms. Alynsia. I am currently a math teacher at Palm Desert High School. I am incredibly passionate about education. I have a five year old daughter, her name is Brantley, and she keeps me on my toes. It’s always an adventure with her around. In my spare time, I enjoy all things Disney, making blankets, building puzzles, and eating good food!</p>

<p> I began my college education career at the local community college. I was only supposed to spend two years there, but it ended up being three because I took one level of American Sign Language and fell in love. I decided to stay one extra year to finish out the four levels the college offered. After that, I transferred to Cal State Chico where I received my Bacherlor’s. I took a year off of school and then went back for my Master’s and teaching credential. I finished those in one year at Alliant University. I took another year off of school and decided to go back. I found myself at University of Missouri pursuing an Educational Specialist Degree. I think after this, my college career may be over. </p>

<p>I just finished my first year teaching. It was an interesting year, to say the least. I spent the last 3 months of school doaing distance learning due to COVID 19. I have also decided to take on summer school for Summer 2020. It has been a huge learning experience and I am excited to see what else I learn and how it can help me in the fall. </p>
